Timur Vorona is IT-journalist, Head of Media Relations at Corezoid.com and business developer in PrivatBank (Ukraine), the 8th largest bank in Eastern Europe. Timur is part of team responsible for PrivatBank digital transformation. Recently PrivatBank has replaced its core systems with an agile cloud-based Corezoid back-end (created in-house in R&amp;D department of the bank). Everything is built around APIs. PrivatBank created Sender messenger (equivalent of Chinese WeChat) as a front-end to talk to its customers and let customers talk to businesses. Sender messenger is based on Corezoid back-end and is designed around mobile lifestyle. Timur is responsible for bringing cutting-edge technologies created in Ukraine on a global scale.
