## Featured Global Partnerships

We can’t drive FinTech-at-SCALE alone — and we don’t want to! We’re grateful for *all* of our partners who are instrumental in strengthening the FinTech ecosystem.

> *"MEDICI is the network focused on FinTech. It’s the spotlight any startup is looking for. It also gives visibility and exposure to every stakeholder you can image in the FinTech sector, such as VCs, Financial Institutions, and global accelerators in more than 56 countries. As a leader in digital innovation for my bank, I’m very excited to be part of MEDICI’s network as well as a judge for the 17 innovations competitions MEDICI will host this year in Italy, alone. I have a saying, “The more I see the less I know. I think it’s a perfect fit to describe my feelings toward the possibility that will unlock for us."*

> **-Matteo Rossanigo, Group Digital Innovation Manager, MEDIOBANCA**

At any given time, MEDICI is working with more than a dozen global, FinTech-focused, open innovation programs. We’re retained by banks, insurance companies, and tech enterprises to design and manage their engagement with startups.
