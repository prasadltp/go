<p>Merchants who accepts card based payments or cardless payments pass on the processing fee that they owe to the companies to their users. The users end up paying more than what the service costs. The business model of higher processing fees for cardless transactions is not an ideal one  for both the users and the merchants (especially small businesses). Some of the popular and not so popular mobile payment apps which are an answer to the higher processing fees are listed below:</p>
<p><b>Google Wallet 2.0</b></p>
<p>Similar to other mobile payment apps listed in this post, Google Wallet allows user to integrate their smartphone with their bank accounts and make a payment. This also means that the merchants have to deal with a relatively low transaction processing fees.</p>
<p>There have been talks that Google Wallet will be integrated with a user’s Gmail account and the users will be able to send money via email. There is a possibility that the mobile payments space will see a significant change if money transfer via email is a hit among the masses.</p>

<p><b>Dwolla</b></p>
<p>The payment network supporting Dwolla doesn’t deal in credit cards. Dwolla allows users to transfer money through their bank accounts at a processing fee of 25 cents (USD) per transaction for transactions worth over $10. Any transaction less than $10 is processed for free. Flat out processing fee charged by Dwolla certainly helps users to avoid understanding the confusing system of payment as fee associated with credit card payments.</p>

<p><b>Merchant Customer Exchange (MCX)</b></p>
<p>MCX is a mobile payment app exclusively developed for retail shopping. A user’s bank account is linked to this app and the user uses his smartphone to pay through the phone.

One of the other main features of this app is that it allows its user’s to redeem coupons and deal at the checkout. The only drawback of using MCX is its need to shop and pay in USA.</p>
<p><b>Bitcoin Wallet (BitPay)</b></p>
<p><a title="Bitcoin, I must have heard about that. But, what’s it all about?" href="http://letstalkpayments.com/bitcoin-i-must-have-heard-about-that-but-whats-it-all-about/">Bitcoin</a> is being accepted by local merchants who accept mobile payments as part of the transaction process. A user can buy Bitcoins online through real cash and use it to buy goods or services.

The only fee that the merchants pay for accepting transactions through Bitcoin Wallet BitPay is 0.99 percent of the total sale. In comparison to other popular mobile payment apps which charge 2.75% per transaction, transactions through BitPay certainly seems to be attractive.</p>
