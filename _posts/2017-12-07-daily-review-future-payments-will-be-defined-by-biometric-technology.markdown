<p>The <a href="https://letstalkpayments.com/the-biometrics-market-is-expected-to-reach-a-value-of-30-bn-by-2021/">biometrics market is expected to experience a substantial growth over the coming years</a>. Some <a href="http://www.acuity-mi.com/GBMR_Report.php">estimates</a> suggest that by 2020, global mobile biometric market revenues will reach $34.6 billion annually. Mobile technology is believed to become a major force in accelerating the adoption of biometrics. More than 800 million biometrically enabled transactions will be completed annually on mobile devices by 2020, generating nearly $7 billion in annual biometric authentication revenue. </p>
<p>To embrace the opportunity and meet ever-increasing consumer expectations from online and offline experiences, Visa makes biometrics the centerpiece of the future of payments. </p>
<h3>Biometrics centerpiece of Visa's new security roadmap</h3>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Visa shared its new <a href="https://www.visa.com.au/pay-with-visa/security/future-of-security-roadmap.html">security roadmap</a>, focusing initially on biometrics, with Joe Cunningham, Head of Risk for Asia Pacific at Visa, touting the technology as having an important place in the future of payments.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">Cunningham said biometrics are now at a point where Visa and its ecosystem of banks, merchants, FinTech firms, service providers, law enforcement, and cardholders feel comfortable supporting it, as he said certain forms of biometrics have reached a stable and secure level.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">"We always expected biometrics to get to a point where they would play an important role in payments, in fact, we expected biometrics to play an important role in our lives as we go about our day-to-day business whether it's accessing buildings, our car, or an online service," he said. "So there's no surprise that payments have been front and center when it comes to biometric adoption. Everyone thinks of biometrics when they think about payments in the future."</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">In addition to biometrics being the immediate focus of Visa, its 2017 priorities also include educating the ecosystem on 3D Secure version 2.0, and to speed up the use of tokenization.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;">"The vision over the long term for security is to completely eliminate all sensitive data from the ecosystem," Cunningham said.</li>
